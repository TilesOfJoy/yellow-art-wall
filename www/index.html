      <p>
        The Yellow Art Wall is a community interest company that aims to
        regenerate local communities by creating welcoming spaces where
        people can meet and engage in art.
      </p>

      <h3>Spaces</h3>

      <p>
        Our first Yellow Art Wall Space is located in Ramsgate at The
        Wooden Box Cafe. We are actively seeking new spaces across the
        UK to host exhibitions and workshops. If you are a cafe,
        restaurant, bar or local community space with a spare wall and
        would like to increase your footfall by becoming a Yellow Art
        Wall space please get in touch at <a
                                            href="mailto:jayne@YellowArtWall.org">jayne@YellowArtWall.org</a>
        .
      </p>

      <h3>Exhibitions</h3>

      <p>
        We offer free monthly art exhibitions in our spaces and our team
        of curators are always looking for fresh artistic talent to
        showcase their work on the Yellow Art Wall. If you are
        interested in exhibiting your work with us please apply via our
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AT9J4gEsZpVWKHTtm3UFvFHwoWTrj5F97C6hUUu66Mc/edit"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google form</a> <span class="link-comment">[opens in new tab]</span>.
      </p>

      <h3>Good Grief Workshops</h3>

      <p>
        At the heart of what we do are free to attend or
        subsidised community workshops which enable people to
        explore subjects such as loss, wellbeing, hope and joy
        in a safe space. Facilitated by a range of artists from
        ceramists to painters, our workshops give people a
        chance to develop new skills and make new friends.
        Everyone is invited and we reach out to our local
        community groups.  If you are interested in facilitating
        a workshop we would love to hear from you. Email <a
